            <div></strong><p>People says I'm crazy, stressed, depressed, weird, delusional, weak, hallucinating, liar, boring, selfish, have no life. I dont give a f*ck just keep talking i'll enjoy all your words, i eat it like a man. I love it when people make assumptions about me.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I see the world differently, I see the world in my own way, I've seen a different reality, I've seen a different me. Same as people do. I talk a lot of things to people but many of them don't believe, don't listen, don't see reality and their lives are like in a system that I can see through and I see them trapped in it.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I change the way i think, i don't think like any other man, i want to be more than any man, and that's my ambition.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I understand the power of imagination, that you are the creator of your own reality.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I have a few partner because I'm different. I'm too boring to live on this earth. I don't seek pleasure in this world. This pleasure that blinds the eyes, mind, and heart, it disturbs my peace.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>Everyone knows what's right and wrong but only few of them having real eyes, realize, real lies.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>The world ain't a sunshine and rainbows it's a very mean and nasty place, you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, that's how winning is done. People says it's okay if you're stupid, it's okay if you're poor, it's okay if you're lazy, it's okay if you're timid, it's okay if you are blabla. It's not f*cking okay, I want to be the best,I want to be genius, I want to be a man, I want to be number one, I want to be rich, I want to have what I want, I want everything.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>As I write this I have nothing. I am nobody.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I wrote this based on the experiments that happened around me, on the actions that were in front of my eyes, you can lie in front of me but don't think I don't know what you are doing, I saw everything.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>What I write here can change the minds of those of you who want to think and who want to change for the better life. Be kind to anybody, don't talk about their sins in the past, spread the good words, talk nicely, make your parents happy, make your friend happy, and be strong there's always be corruption around you and don't fell for it.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>I've lost my mind on this game like Vincent Van Gogh dedicated his life to his art and he lost his mind in the process and i'm happy that i lost my mind.</p></div>
            <div></strong><p>Think about all that i write from the first page, why not? are you denial? or am i wrong?.</p></div>
